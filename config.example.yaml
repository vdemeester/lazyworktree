# DIFF & PAGER
# ============================================================================

# Maximum number of untracked files to show diffs for (0 disables diff display for untracked files)
max_untracked_diffs: 10

# Maximum characters to read from diff output (0 disables truncation)
max_diff_chars: 200000

# Path to delta executable for enhanced diffs
# Set to empty string ("") to disable delta and use plain git diff output
# Example: delta_path: ""  # disables delta
# Example: delta_path: /usr/local/bin/delta  # custom path
delta_path: delta

# Extra arguments passed to delta for diff rendering
# If you omit this setting, lazyworktree will automatically choose a syntax theme

# delta_args:
#   - --syntax-theme
#   - Dracula

# Pager used for show_output custom commands
# Default: $PAGER environment variable or less if unset

# EDITOR
# ============================================================================

# Editor for opening files from the Status pane
# Default: $EDITOR environment variable, then nvim, then vi

# ============================================================================
# BRANCH NAMING
# ============================================================================

# Template for issue branch names when creating worktrees from issues
# Available placeholders:
#   {number} - The issue number
#   {title}  - The sanitised issue title
# Examples:
#   issue_branch_name_template: "issue-{number}-{title}"  # issue-123-fix-login-bug
#   issue_branch_name_template: "{number}-{title}"        # 123-fix-login-bug
#   issue_branch_name_template: "fix/{number}-{title}"    # fix/123-fix-login-bug
issue_branch_name_template: "issue-{number}-{title}"

# Template for PR branch names when creating worktrees from pull requests
# Available placeholders:
#   {number} - The PR number
#   {title}  - The sanitised PR title
# Examples:
#   pr_branch_name_template: "pr-{number}-{title}"    # pr-123-fix-login-bug
#   pr_branch_name_template: "pr{number}-{title}"     # pr123-fix-login-bug
#   pr_branch_name_template: "{number}-{title}"       # 123-fix-login-bug
pr_branch_name_template: "pr-{number}-{title}"

# Script to generate branch name suggestions when creating worktrees from changes or issues
# The script receives the git diff (for changes) or issue title+body (for issues) on stdin
# and should output a suggested branch name
# Useful for AI-powered branch name generation
# Examples:
#   branch_name_script: "aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash 'Generate a short git branch name for this diff'"
#   branch_name_script: "claude 'Suggest a branch name based on this diff'"
# branch_name_script: ""

# GIT OPERATIONS
# ============================================================================

# Automatically fetch pull requests/merge requests when opening a repository
auto_fetch_prs: false

# Merge method for the "Absorb worktree" action
# Options: "rebase" (rebases onto main, then fast-forwards main to the branch)
#          "merge" (creates a merge commit on main)
merge_method: "rebase"

# ============================================================================
# SECURITY
# ============================================================================

# Security setting for executing commands from .wt files
# Options: "tofu" (Trust On First Use - prompts you the first time or when commands change)
#          "never" (skips all commands from .wt files)
#          "always" (executes without prompting - use with caution)
trust_mode: "tofu"

# Debug log file path (for troubleshooting)
# When set, lazyworktree writes debug information to this file
# Leave commented out unless you're diagnosing issues
# debug_log: "/tmp/lazyworktree-debug.log"

# ============================================================================
# LIFECYCLE HOOKS
# ============================================================================
#
# Environment variables available to init_commands, terminate_commands, and custom_commands:
#   WORKTREE_PATH       - Path to the worktree
#   WORKTREE_BRANCH     - Name of the git branch
#   WORKTREE_NAME       - Name of the worktree (directory basename)
#   MAIN_WORKTREE_PATH  - Path to the main repository
#   REPO_NAME           - Repository key (from GitHub/GitLab or local hash)

# Commands to run after creating a new worktree
# Executes when creating worktrees from branches, PRs, issues, or changes
# Execution order: global config commands first, then repository-specific commands from .wt files
#
# Special built-in command:
#   link_topsymlinks    - Symlinks untracked/ignored files from main worktree root,
#                         editor configs (.vscode, .idea, .cursor, .claude),
#                         creates tmp/ directory, runs direnv allow if .envrc exists
#
# Security: Commands from .wt files require trust confirmation (see trust_mode setting)
#
# Examples:
#   - link_topsymlinks                                    # Symlink config files
#   - cp $MAIN_WORKTREE_PATH/.env $WORKTREE_PATH/.env   # Copy environment
#   - npm install                                         # Install dependencies
init_commands:
  - link_topsymlinks

# Commands to run before deleting a worktree
# Executes when deleting individual worktrees or pruning merged worktrees
# Execution order: global config commands first, then repository-specific commands from .wt files
#
# Environment variables: Same as init_commands (see above)
# Security: Commands from .wt files require trust confirmation (see trust_mode setting)
#
# Examples:
#   - echo "Cleaning up $WORKTREE_NAME"        # Log cleanup
#   - rm -rf $WORKTREE_PATH/tmp/*              # Remove temporary files
terminate_commands:
  - echo "Cleaning up $WORKTREE_NAME"

# ============================================================================
# CUSTOM COMMANDS
# ============================================================================

# Custom keybindings to run commands in the selected worktree
# Commands are executed interactively (TUI suspends, similar to lazygit)
# Note: Custom commands take precedence over built-in keys (e.g., 's' will override the sort toggle)
#
# Environment variables: Same as lifecycle hooks (see above)
#
# Supported key formats:
#   - Single keys: e, s, t, l
#   - Modifier combinations: "ctrl+e", "alt+t", "ctrl+shift+s"
#   - Special keys: enter, esc, tab, space
#
# Fields:
#   command: The command to execute (required)
#   description: Description shown in help screen (optional)
#   show_help: Show in help screen and footer hints (default: false)
#   wait: Wait for keypress after command completes (default: false, useful for quick commands)
#   show_output: Display command output in the pager instead of running interactively (default: false)

# CUSTOM MENUS
# ============================================================================

# Custom items for the worktree creation menu (triggered by 'c' key)
# Each item runs an external command that outputs a branch name
# Workflow: select base branch first, then command runs, then you enter/confirm the branch name
#
# Non-interactive commands run with a 30-second timeout
# Output (first line, whitespace trimmed, case preserved) is used as the suggested name
#
# Fields:
#   label: Display label shown in the menu (required)
#   description: Help text shown next to the label (optional)
#   command: Shell command that outputs a branch name on stdout (required)
#   interactive: Run interactively (default: false). Set to true for TUI-based
#                commands like fzf or jayrah. Suspends lazyworktree, runs the
#                command in the terminal, and captures stdout via temp file
#   post_command: Command to run in new worktree after creation (optional)
#                 Runs after global/repo init_commands. Has access to environment
#                 variables like WORKTREE_BRANCH, WORKTREE_PATH, etc.
#   post_interactive: Run post-command interactively (default: false). When true,
#                     TUI suspends to show command I/O
