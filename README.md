<img align="right" width="180" height="180" alt="lw-logo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77b63679-40b8-494c-a62d-19ccc39ac38e" />

LazyWorktree is a terminal user interface for managing Git worktrees. It
provides a structured, keyboard-driven workflow for creating, inspecting, and
navigating multiple worktrees within a single repository.

Built with [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), it focuses on fast iteration, clear state visibility, and tight integration with common Git tooling.

## Features

* Worktree management: Create, rename, remove, absorb, and prune merged worktrees.
* Powerful creation options:
  * From current branch: Create from the current branch, optionally carrying over uncommitted changes.
  * Checkout existing branch: Associate a worktree with an existing local branch, or create a new branch based on it.
  * From issue: Create from a GitHub/GitLab issue with automatic branch naming.
  * From PR or MR: Create from an open GitHub/GitLab pull or merge request.
* Show linked GitHub PR or Gitlab MR, CI status, and checks.
* Stage, unstage, commit, edit, and diff files interactively.
* View diffs in a pager, with optional delta integration.
* Manage per-worktree Tmux or Zellij sessions.
* Cherry-pick commits from one worktree to another.
* Access actions, commands, and sessions with MRU-based navigation via a VSCode-like command palette.
* Custom commands support. Define keybindings, tmux/zellij layouts, and per-repo command workflows.
* Automation and hooks: Run init/terminate commands via `.wt` files with TOFU security.
* Shell integration: Jump into selected worktrees and return to the last-used one.
* Automatic branch naming: Generate branch names from diffs, issues, or PRs via
scripts (like LLM tools).

## Getting Started

1. Install lazyworktree using your preferred method below.
2. Run `lazyworktree` inside a Git repository.
3. Press `?` for help and key hints.

Common overrides:

```bash
lazyworktree --worktree-dir ~/worktrees

# Override config values via command line
lazyworktree --config lw.theme=nord --config lw.auto_fetch_prs=true
```

## Requirements

* **Git**: 2.31+ (recommended)
* **Forge CLI**: GitHub CLI (`gh`) or GitLab CLI (`glab`) for repo resolution and PR/MR status

**Optional:**

* **delta**: For syntax-highlighted diffs (highly recommended)
* **lazygit**: For full TUI git control
* **tmux**: For tmux integration support
* **zellij**: For zellij integration support

**Build-time only:**

* Go 1.25 or newer

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for various platforms are provided in the [Releases](https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree/releases) section.

### 🍺 Homebrew (macOS)

```shell
brew tap chmouel/lazyworktree https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree
brew install lazyworktree --cask
```

#### macOS Gatekeeper

macOS quarantines binaries downloaded from the internet. On first run you may
see "Apple could not verify lazyworktree". To resolve this:

**Option 1:** Allow via System Settings

1. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security
2. Click "Open Anyway" next to the lazyworktree warning

**Option 2:** Remove the quarantine attribute

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /opt/homebrew/bin/lazyworktree
```

### [Arch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazyworktree-bin)

```shell
yay -S lazyworktree-bin
```

### From Source

Clone the repository and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree.git
cd lazyworktree
go build -o lazyworktree ./cmd/lazyworktree
```

Install to your PATH:

```bash
go install ./cmd/lazyworktree
```

Or build and run directly:

```bash
go run ./cmd/lazyworktree/main.go
```

## Shell Integration

LazyWorktree provides shell helpers to change the current directory to the
selected worktree on exit. These helpers are optional but recommended for
interactive use.

Zsh helpers are provided under shell/functions.shell and can be sourced
directly or downloaded.

See [./shell/README.md](./shell/README.md) for more detailed instructions.

## CLI Usage

LazyWorktree supports command-line operations for creating and deleting worktrees without launching the TUI. The legacy `wt-create` and `wt-delete` CLI names still work as aliases for the new `create` and `delete` subcommands.

### Creating Worktrees

**Create from current branch:**

```bash
# Auto-generated name from current branch
lazyworktree create

# Explicit name
lazyworktree create my-feature

# With uncommitted changes
lazyworktree create --with-change

# Explicit name + changes
lazyworktree create my-feature --with-change
```

**Create from a specific branch:**

```bash
# Explicit name
lazyworktree create --from-branch main my-feature [--with-change] [--silent]

# Auto-generated name (sanitised from source branch)
lazyworktree create --from-branch feature/new-feature [--with-change] [--silent]
```

The worktree/branch name can be specified explicitly or auto-generated:

* **Current branch + explicit name:** `lw create my-feature`
* **Specific branch + explicit name:** `lw create --from-branch main my-feature`
* **Current branch + auto-generated:** `lw create` uses current branch name
* **Specific branch + auto-generated:** `lw create --from-branch feature/cool-thing` creates "feature-cool-thing"
* Names are automatically sanitised to lowercase alphanumeric characters with hyphens

**Create from a PR:**

```bash
lazyworktree create --from-pr 123 [--silent]
```

### Deleting Worktrees

```bash
lazyworktree delete [--no-branch] [--silent]
```

Deletes the worktree and associated branch (only if worktree name matches branch name). Use `--no-branch` to skip branch deletion.

## Configuration

Worktrees are expected to be organised under `~/.local/share/worktrees/<organization>-<repo_name>` by default unless overridden via configuration.

### Global Configuration (YAML)

lazyworktree reads `~/.config/lazyworktree/config.yaml` (or `.yml`) for default settings. An example configuration is provided below (also available in [config.example.yaml](./config.example.yaml)):

```yaml
worktree_dir: ~/.local/share/worktrees

max_untracked_diffs: 10
max_diff_chars: 200000
max_name_length: 95       # Maximum length for worktree names in table display (0 disables truncation)
theme: ""       # Leave empty to auto-detect based on terminal background colour
                # (defaults to "dracula" for dark, "dracula-light" for light).
                # Options: see the Themes section below.
git_pager: delta
pager: "less --use-color --wordwrap -qcR -P 'Press q to exit..'"

custom_commands:
  t:
    command: make test
    description: Run tests
    show_help: true
    wait: true
# Custom worktree creation menu items
custom_create_menus:
  - label: "From JIRA ticket"

    command: "pbpaste"
```

### Configuration Precedence

lazyworktree reads configuration from multiple sources with the following precedence (highest to lowest):

1. **CLI overrides** (using `--config` flag): Highest priority
2. **Git local configuration** (repository-specific via `git config --local`)
3. **Git global configuration** (user-wide via `git config --global`)
4. **YAML configuration file** (`~/.config/lazyworktree/config.yaml`)
5. **Built-in defaults**: Lowest priority

This allows flexible configuration at different levels. For example, you can set a default theme globally in your Git config, override it for a specific repository, and temporarily change it via the command line.

### Git Configuration

Settings can be stored in Git's configuration system with the `lw.` prefix. Examples:

```bash
# Set globally
git config --global lw.theme nord
git config --global lw.auto_fetch_prs true
git config --global lw.worktree_dir ~/.local/share/worktrees

# Set per-repository
git config --local lw.theme dracula
git config --local lw.init_commands "link_topsymlinks"
git config --local lw.init_commands "npm install"  # Multi-values supported
```

To view configured values:

```bash
git config --global --get-regexp "^lw\."
git config --local --get-regexp "^lw\."
```

### Settings

**Themes**

* `theme` selects the colour theme. See [Themes](#themes). Default: auto-detected (`dracula` for dark, `dracula-light` for light).
* Execute `lazyworktree --show-syntax-themes` to display the default delta `--syntax-theme` values for each UI theme.
* Use `lazyworktree --theme <name>` to select a UI theme directly.

**Worktree list and refresh**

* `sort_mode`: `"switched"` (last accessed, default), `"active"` (commit date), or `"path"` (alphabetical).
* `auto_fetch_prs`: fetch PR data on startup.
* `auto_refresh`: background refresh of git metadata (default: true).
* `refresh_interval`: refresh frequency in seconds (default: 10).
* `show_icons`: display icons (default: true).
* `max_untracked_diffs`, `max_diff_chars`: limits for diff display (0 disables).
* `max_name_length`: maximum display length for worktree names (default: 95, 0 disables truncation).

**Search and palette**

* `search_auto_select`: start with filter focused (or use `--search-auto-select`).
* `fuzzy_finder_input`: show fuzzy suggestions in input dialogs.
* `palette_mru`: enable MRU sorting in command palette (default: true). Control count with `palette_mru_limit` (default: 5).

**Diff, pager, and editor**

* `git_pager`: diff formatter (default: `delta`). Empty string disables formatting.
* `git_pager_args`: arguments for git_pager. Auto-selects syntax theme for delta.
* `git_pager_interactive`: set `true` for interactive viewers like `diffnav` or `tig`.
* `pager`: pager for output display (default: `$PAGER`, fallback to `less`).
* `editor`: editor for Status pane `e` key (default: `$EDITOR`, fallback to `nvim`).

**Worktree lifecycle**

* `init_commands` and `terminate_commands` execute prior to any repository-specific `.wt` commands (if present).

**Sync and multiplexers**

* `merge_method`: `"rebase"` (default) or `"merge"`. Controls Absorb and Sync (`S`) behaviour.
* `session_prefix`: prefix for tmux/zellij sessions (default: `wt-`). Palette filters by this prefix.

**Branch naming**

* `branch_name_script`: script for automatic branch suggestions. See [Automatically generated branch names](#automatically-generated-branch-names).
* `issue_branch_name_template`, `pr_branch_name_template`: templates with placeholders `{number}`, `{title}`, `{generated}`.

**Custom create menu**

* `custom_create_menus`: add custom items to the creation menu (`c` key). Supports `interactive` and `post_command`.

To select a theme, configure it in your configuration file:

```yaml
theme: dracula  # or any listed above
```

### Custom Themes

You can define custom themes in your configuration file that inherit from built-in themes or define completely new colour schemes.

**Inheriting from a built-in theme:**

```yaml
custom_themes:
  my-dark:
    base: dracula
    accent: "#FF6B9D"
    text_fg: "#E8E8E8"

  my-light:
    base: dracula-light
    accent: "#0066CC"
```

**Defining a complete theme (all 11 colour fields required):**

```yaml
custom_themes:
  completely-custom:
    accent: "#00FF00"
    accent_fg: "#000000"
    accent_dim: "#2A2A2A"
    border: "#3A3A3A"
    border_dim: "#2A2A2A"
    muted_fg: "#888888"
    text_fg: "#FFFFFF"
    success_fg: "#00FF00"
    warn_fg: "#FFFF00"
    error_fg: "#FF0000"
    cyan: "#00FFFF"
```

**Custom themes can inherit from other custom themes:**

```yaml
custom_themes:
  base-custom:
    base: dracula
    accent: "#FF0000"
  derived:
    base: base-custom
    accent: "#00FF00"
```

**Available colour fields:**

* `accent` - Primary accent colour (highlights, selected items)
* `accent_fg` - Foreground colour for text on accent background
* `accent_dim` - Dimmed accent colour (selected rows/panels)
* `border` - Border colour
* `border_dim` - Dimmed border colour
* `muted_fg` - Muted text colour
* `text_fg` - Primary text colour
* `success_fg` - Success indicator colour
* `warn_fg` - Warning indicator colour
* `error_fg` - Error indicator colour
* `cyan` - Cyan accent colour

Colour values must be in hex format (`#RRGGBB` or `#RGB`). When using a `base` theme, only specify colours you want to override. When not using a base, all 11 colour fields are required.

Custom themes appear in the theme selection screen alongside built-in themes.

## CI Status Display

When viewing a worktree with an associated PR/MR, lazyworktree automatically retrieves and displays CI check statuses in the information pane.

* `✓` **Green** - Passed
* `✗` **Red** - Failed
* `●` **Yellow** - Pending/Running
* `○` **Grey** - Skipped
* `⊘` **Grey** - Cancelled

CI status is retrieved lazily (only for the selected worktree) and cached for 30 seconds to maintain UI responsiveness. Press `p` to force a refresh of CI status.

## Custom Commands

Define custom keybindings in `~/.config/lazyworktree/config.yaml`. Commands run interactively (TUI suspends) and appear in the command palette. Use `show_output` to pipe output through the pager.

Defaults: `t` opens tmux, `Z` opens zellij. Override by defining `custom_commands.t` or `custom_commands.Z`. The palette lists active sessions matching `session_prefix` (default: `wt-`).

### Configuration Format

Add a `custom_commands` section to your config:

```yaml
custom_commands:
  e:
    command: nvim
    description: Editor
    show_help: true
  s:
    command: zsh
    description: Shell
    show_help: true
  T: # Run tests and wait for keypress
    command: make test
    description: Run tests
    show_help: false
    wait: true
  o: # Show output in the pager
    command: git status -sb
    description: Status
    show_help: true
    show_output: true
  a: # Open CLaude CLI in the selected workspace in a new kitty tab
    command: "kitten @ launch --type tab --cwd $WORKTREE_PATH -- claude"
    description: Open Claude
    show_help: true
  t: # Open a tmux session with multiple windows
    description: Tmux
    show_help: true
    tmux: # If you specify zellij instead of tmux this would manage zellij sessions
      session_name: "wt:$WORKTREE_NAME"
      attach: true
      on_exists: switch
      windows:
        - name: claude
          command: claude
        - name: shell
          command: zsh
        - name: lazygit
          command: lazygit
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `command` | string | **required** | The command to execute |
| `description` | string | `""` | Description shown in the help screen and command palette |
| `show_help` | bool | `false` | Whether to show this command in the help screen (`?`) and footer hints |
| `wait` | bool | `false` | Wait for key press after command completes (useful for quick commands like `ls` or `make test`) |
| `show_output` | bool | `false` | Run non-interactively and show stdout/stderr in the pager (ignores `wait`) |
| `tmux` | object | `null` | Configure a tmux session instead of executing a single command |
| `zellij` | object | `null` | Configure a zellij session instead of executing a single command |

#### tmux fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `session_name` | string | `wt:$WORKTREE_NAME` | Session name (env vars supported, special chars replaced) |
| `attach` | bool | `true` | Attach immediately; if false, show modal with instructions |
| `on_exists` | string | `switch` | Behaviour if session exists: `switch`, `attach`, `kill`, `new` |
| `windows` | list | `[ { name: "shell" } ]` | Window definitions for the session |

If `windows` is omitted or empty, lazyworktree creates a single `shell` window.

#### tmux window fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | `window-N` | Window name (supports env vars) |
| `command` | string | `""` | Command to run in the window (empty uses your default shell) |
| `cwd` | string | `$WORKTREE_PATH` | Working directory for the window (supports env vars) |

#### zellij fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `session_name` | string | `wt:$WORKTREE_NAME` | Session name (env vars supported, special chars replaced) |
| `attach` | bool | `true` | Attach immediately; if false, show modal with instructions |
| `on_exists` | string | `switch` | Behaviour if session exists: `switch`, `attach`, `kill`, `new` |
| `windows` | list | `[ { name: "shell" } ]` | Tab definitions for the session |

If `windows` is omitted or empty, lazyworktree creates a single `shell` tab.
Zellij session names cannot include `/`, `\`, or `:`, so lazyworktree replaces them with `-`.

#### zellij window fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | `window-N` | Tab name (supports env vars) |
| `command` | string | `""` | Command to run in the tab (empty uses your default shell) |
| `cwd` | string | `$WORKTREE_PATH` | Working directory for the tab (supports env vars) |

### Environment Variables

Custom commands have access to the same environment variables as init/terminate commands:

* `WORKTREE_BRANCH`: Name of the git branch
* `MAIN_WORKTREE_PATH`: Path to the main repository
* `WORKTREE_PATH`: Path to the selected worktree
* `WORKTREE_NAME`: Name of the worktree (directory name)
* `REPO_NAME`: Name of the repository (from GitHub/GitLab)

### Supported Key Formats

Custom commands support the same key formats as built-in keybindings:

* **Single keys**: `e`, `s`, `t`, `l`, etc.
* **Modifier combinations**: `ctrl+e`, `ctrl+t`, `alt+s`, etc.
* **Special keys**: `enter`, `esc`, `tab`, `space`, etc.

**Examples:**

```yaml
custom_commands:
  "ctrl+e":
    command: nvim
    description: Open editor with Ctrl+E
  "alt+t":
    command: make test
    description: Run tests with Alt+T
    wait: true
```

### Key Precedence

**Custom commands take precedence over built-in keys.** If you define a custom command with key `s`, it overrides the built-in sort toggle.

## Custom Initialisation and Termination

Create a `.wt` file in your main repository to define commands that run when creating or removing a worktree. Format inspired by [wt](https://github.com/taecontrol/wt).

### Example `.wt` configuration

```yaml
init_commands:
    - link_topsymlinks
    - cp $MAIN_WORKTREE_PATH/.env $WORKTREE_PATH/.env
    - npm install
    - code .

terminate_commands:
    - echo "Cleaning up $WORKTREE_NAME"
```

The following environment variables are available to your commands:

* `WORKTREE_BRANCH`: Name of the git branch.
* `MAIN_WORKTREE_PATH`: Path to the main repository.
* `WORKTREE_PATH`: Path to the new worktree being created or removed.
* `WORKTREE_NAME`: Name of the worktree (directory name).

### Security: Trust on First Use (TOFU)

Since `.wt` files can execute arbitrary commands, lazyworktree uses a **Trust on First Use** security model.

* **First Run**: When encountering a new or modified `.wt` file, lazyworktree pauses and displays the commands. Select **Trust** (run and save), **Block** (skip), or **Cancel**.
* **Trusted**: Once trusted, commands run silently in the background until the `.wt` file changes again.
* **Persistence**: Trusted file hashes are stored in `~/.local/share/lazyworktree/trusted.json`.

Configure via `trust_mode` in `config.yaml`:

* **`tofu`** (Default): Prompts for confirmation on new or changed files. Secure and usable.
* **`never`**: Never runs commands from `.wt` files. Safest for untrusted environments.
* **`always`**: Always runs commands without prompting. Useful for personal/internal environments but risky.

### Special Commands

* `link_topsymlinks`: A built-in automation command (not a shell command) that executes without TOFU prompts once the `.wt` file is trusted. It performs the following:
  * Symlinks all untracked and ignored files from the root of the main worktree to the new worktree (excluding subdirectories).
  * Symlinks common editor configurations (`.vscode`, `.idea`, `.cursor`, `.claude`).
  * Ensures a `tmp/` directory exists in the new worktree.
  * Automatically runs `direnv allow` if a `.envrc` file is present.

## Branch Naming Conventions

Special characters are converted to hyphens for Git compatibility. Leading/trailing hyphens are removed, consecutive hyphens collapsed. Length capped at 50 (manual) or 100 (auto) characters.

| Input | Converted |
|-------|-----------|
| `feature.new` | `feature-new` |
| `bug fix here` | `bug-fix-here` |
| `feature:test` | `feature-test` |

## Automatically Generated Branch Names

Configure `branch_name_script` to generate branch names via a helper tool, for example [aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/) or [claude code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).

* **PRs/issues:** Script outputs a title available via `{generated}` placeholder.
* **Diffs:** Script outputs a complete branch name.

> [!NOTE]
> Smaller, faster models are usually sufficient for short branch names. Choose a tool and model that fit your workflow.

### Configuration

Add `branch_name_script` to your `~/.config/lazyworktree/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# For PRs/issues: generate a title (available via {generated} placeholder)
branch_name_script: "aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite 'Generate a short title for this PR or issue. Output only the title (like feat-ai-session-manager), nothing else.'"

# Choose which template to use:
pr_branch_name_template: "pr-{number}-{generated}"  # Use generated title
# pr_branch_name_template: "pr-{number}-{title}"    # Use original PR title
# pr_branch_name_template: "pr-{number}-{generated}-{title}"  # Use both!

# For diffs: generate a complete branch name
# branch_name_script: "aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite 'Generate a short git branch name (no spaces, use hyphens) for this diff. Output only the branch name, nothing else.'"
```

### Template Placeholders

When creating worktrees from PRs or issues, the following placeholders are available:

* `{number}` - The PR/issue number
* `{title}` - The original sanitised PR/issue title (always available)
* `{generated}` - The generated title (falls back to `{title}` if the script is not configured or returns empty output)
* `{pr_author}` - The PR author's username (PRs only, sanitised)

**Examples:**

| Template | Result (PR #2 by @alice: "Add AI session management") | Generated: `feat-ai-session-manager` |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `pr-{number}-{title}` | `pr-2-add-ai-session-management` | Not used |
| `pr-{number}-{generated}` | `pr-2-feat-ai-session-manager` | Used |
| `pr-{number}-{pr_author}-{title}` | `pr-2-alice-add-ai-session-management` | Not used |
| `pr-{number}-{pr_author}-{generated}` | `pr-2-alice-feat-ai-session-manager` | Used |

If the script fails or returns empty output, `{generated}` automatically falls back to the sanitised original title.

### Script Requirements

The script receives content on stdin (diff, issue, or PR title+body) and outputs the branch name on stdout (first line used). Timeout: 30 seconds. Falls back to the original title if the script fails.

### Environment Variables

Available to scripts: `LAZYWORKTREE_TYPE` (pr/issue/diff), `LAZYWORKTREE_NUMBER`, `LAZYWORKTREE_TEMPLATE`, `LAZYWORKTREE_SUGGESTED_NAME`.

**Example:**

```yaml
# Different prompts for different types
branch_name_script: |
  if [ "$LAZYWORKTREE_TYPE" = "diff" ]; then
    aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite 'Generate a complete branch name for this diff'
  else
    aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite 'Generate a short title (no pr- prefix) for this PR/issue'
  fi

# Use PR/issue number in the prompt
branch_name_script: |
  aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite "Generate a title for PR #$LAZYWORKTREE_NUMBER. Output only the title."
```

## How does it compare?

lazyworktree covers a broader set of use cases than most Git worktree tools,
especially for interactive and human-driven workflows.

For a fair and detailed comparison with other popular worktree managers
(including their respective strengths and trade-offs), see
the [COMPARAISON](./COMPARAISON.md) document.

## Trivia

Previously, this was a Python textual application; however, the startup time proved excessive, prompting a migration to a Go-based [charmbracelet bubble](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) Terminal User Interface. The original Python implementation remains available for review or testing at <https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree/tree/python>
