# LazyWorktree - Easy Git worktree management for the terminal

<img align="right" width="180" height="180" alt="logo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce45297c-1666-4c52-ac29-983b39389fd7" />


LazyWorktree is a TUI for Git worktrees. It provides a keyboard-driven workflow
for creating, inspecting, and navigating worktrees within a repository.

Built with [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), it focuses on fast iteration, clear state visibility, and tight Git tooling integration.

_See other [Screenshots below](#screenshots)_

## Features

* Worktree management: create, rename, remove, absorb, and prune merged worktrees.
* Powerful creation options:
  * From current branch, optionally with uncommitted changes.
  * Checkout existing branch or create a new branch from it.
  * From GitHub/GitLab issue with automatic branch naming.
  * From open GitHub/GitLab PR or MR.
* VIM style keybinding and a VSCode-like command palette (and as configurable
as emacs!).
* View CI logs from GitHub Actions.
* Display linked PR/MR, CI status, and checks.
* Stage, unstage, commit, edit, and diff files.
* View diffs in a pager with optional delta integration.
* Manage per-worktree tmux or zellij sessions.
* Cherry-pick commits between worktrees.
* Command palette with MRU-based navigation.
* Custom commands: define keybindings, tmux/zellij layouts, and per-repo workflows.
* Init/terminate hooks via `.wt` files with TOFU security.
* Simple per-worktree notes and todo editor with markdown support and external editor integration.
* Taskboard: view markdown checkbox tasks grouped by worktree and toggle completion.
* Shell integration: jump into worktrees and return to the last-used one.
* Automatic branch naming via scripts (e.g., LLM tools).

## Getting Started

* Install lazyworktree using one of the methods below
* Navigate to a Git repository in your terminal
* Run lazyworktree to launch the TUI
* Press ? to view the interactive help screen
* When pressing ENTER Lazyworktree will by default output the path
  of the worktree. To let you "jump" to it from your shell
  you may want to automate it like this:

  ```cd $(lazyworktree)```

  See [here](./shell/README.md) for more advanced shell integrations.

## Requirements

* **Git**: 2.31+
* **Forge CLI**: `gh` or `glab` for PR/MR status

**Optional:**

* Nerd Font: Icons default to Nerd Font glyphs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you see weird characters when starting lazyworktree, set `icon_set: text` or install a font patched with Nerd Font.

* delta: Syntax-highlighted diffs (recommended)
* lazygit: Full TUI git control
* tmux / zellij: Session management
* [aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat) or similar LLM cli for automatic
branch naming from diffs/issues/PRs.

**Build-time only:**

* Go 1.25+

**Notes Viewer and Editor**

Press `i` to open notes for the selected worktree. If a note already exists,
lazyworktree opens a viewer first; if no note exists, it opens the editor.

In the note viewer, use `j`/`k` (or arrow keys) to scroll, `Ctrl+D`/`Ctrl+U`
for half-page navigation, `g`/`G` for top/bottom, `e` to edit, and `q`/`Esc`
to close.

In the note editor, use `Ctrl+S` to save, `Enter` to add a new line, and `Esc`
to cancel. Worktrees with notes display a note marker beside the name. The Info
pane renders Markdown formatting for headings, bold text, inline code, lists,
quotes, links, and fenced code blocks. Uppercase note tags such as `TODO`,
`FIXME`, or `WARNING:` are highlighted with icons outside fenced code blocks,
whilst lowercase tags remain unchanged.

**Taskboard**

Press `T` to open Taskboard, a Kanban-lite view grouped by worktree. Taskboard
collects only markdown checkbox items from notes (for example, `- [ ] draft
release notes` and `- [x] update changelog`). Use `j`/`k` to move, `Enter` or
`Space` to toggle completion, `a` to add a new task, `f` to filter, and
`q`/`Esc` to close.

**Log Pane** (when focused on commit log):

| `Enter` | Open CI job in browser |
| `Ctrl+v` | View CI logs in pager |
| `Ctrl+r` | Restart CI job (GitHub Actions only) |

**Filter Mode:**

Applies to focused pane (worktrees, files, commits). Active filter shows `[Esc] Clear` hint.

Selection menus: press `f` to show the filter input; `Esc` returns to the list and keeps the current filter.

* `alt+n`, `alt+p`: Navigate and update filter input
* `↑`, `↓`, `ctrl+j`, `ctrl+k`: Navigate without changing input
* `Enter`: Exit filter mode (filter remains)
* `Esc`, `Ctrl+C`: Clear filter

**Search Mode:**

### Configuration Precedence

Highest to lowest priority:

1. **CLI overrides** (`--config` flag)
2. **Git local configuration** (`git config --local`)
3. **Git global configuration** (`git config --global`)
4. **YAML configuration file** (`~/.config/lazyworktree/config.yaml`)
5. **Built-in defaults**

### Git Configuration

Use the `lw.` prefix:

```bash
# Set globally
git config --global lw.theme nord
git config --global lw.worktree_dir ~/.local/share/worktrees

# Set per-repository
git config --local lw.theme dracula
git config --local lw.init_commands "link_topsymlinks"
git config --local lw.init_commands "npm install"  # Multi-values supported
```

To view configured values:

```bash
git config --global --get-regexp "^lw\."
git config --local --get-regexp "^lw\."
```

### Settings

**Themes**

* `theme`: colour theme (auto-detected: `dracula` dark, `dracula-light` light). See [Themes](#themes).
* `lazyworktree --show-syntax-themes`: show delta syntax-theme defaults.
* `lazyworktree --theme <name>`: select UI theme.

**Worktree list and refresh**

* `sort_mode`: `"switched"` (last accessed, default), `"active"` (commit date), or `"path"` (alphabetical).
* `layout`: pane arrangement — `"default"` (worktrees left, status/log stacked right) or `"top"` (worktrees full-width top, status/log side-by-side bottom). Toggle at runtime with `L`.
* `auto_refresh`: background refresh of git metadata (default: true).
* `ci_auto_refresh`: periodically refresh CI status for GitHub repositories (default: false).
* `refresh_interval`: refresh frequency in seconds (default: 10).
* `icon_set`: choose icon set ("nerd-font-v3", "text").
* `max_untracked_diffs`, `max_diff_chars`: limits for diff display (0 disables).
* `max_name_length`: maximum display length for worktree names (default: 95, 0 disables truncation).

**Search and palette**

* `search_auto_select`: start with filter focused (or use `--search-auto-select`).
* `fuzzy_finder_input`: show fuzzy suggestions in input dialogues.
* `palette_mru`: enable MRU sorting in command palette (default: true). Control count with `palette_mru_limit` (default: 5).

**Diff, pager, and editor**

* `git_pager`: diff formatter (default: `delta`). Empty string disables formatting.
* `git_pager_args`: arguments for git_pager. Auto-selects syntax theme for delta.
* `git_pager_interactive`: set `true` for interactive viewers like `diffnav` or `tig`.
* `git_pager_command_mode`: set `true` for command-based diff viewers like `lumen` that run their own git commands (e.g. `lumen diff`).
* `pager`: pager for output display (default: `$PAGER`, fallback to `less`).
* `ci_script_pager`: pager for CI logs with direct terminal control. Falls back to `pager`. Example to strip GitHub Actions timestamps:

```yaml
ci_script_pager: |
  sed -E '
  s/.*[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}T([0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2})\.[0-9]+Z[[:space:]]*/\1 /;
  t;
  s/.*UNKNOWN STEP[[:space:]]+//' | \
   tee /tmp/.ci.${LW_CI_JOB_NAME_CLEAN}-${LW_CI_STARTED_AT}.md |
  less --use-color -q --wordwrap -qcR -P 'Press q to exit..'
```

CI environment variables: `LW_CI_JOB_NAME`, `LW_CI_JOB_NAME_CLEAN`, `LW_CI_RUN_ID`, `LW_CI_STARTED_AT`.

* `editor`: editor for Status pane `e` key (default: `$EDITOR`, fallback to `nvim`).

**Worktree lifecycle**

* `init_commands`, `terminate_commands`: run before repository `.wt` commands.
* `worktree_notes_path`: optional path to store all worktree notes in one shared JSON file. In this mode, note keys are repo/worktree-relative (not absolute paths), making cross-system sync easier.

**Sync and multiplexers**

* `merge_method`: `"rebase"` (default) or `"merge"`. Controls Absorb and Sync (`S`) behaviour.
* `session_prefix`: prefix for tmux/zellij sessions (default: `wt-`). Palette filters by this prefix.

**Branch naming**

* `branch_name_script`: script for automatic branch suggestions. See [Automatically generated branch names](#automatically-generated-branch-names).
* `issue_branch_name_template`: template with placeholders `{number}`, `{title}`, `{generated}`.
* `pr_branch_name_template`: template with placeholders `{number}`, `{title}`, `{generated}`, `{pr_author}`.
* `worktree_note_script`: script for automatic worktree notes when creating from PR/MR or issue.

**Custom create menu**

* `custom_create_menus`: add custom items to the creation menu (`c` key). Supports `interactive` and `post_command`.

### Custom Themes

Define custom themes that inherit from built-in themes or define new colour schemes.

**Inherit from built-in:**

```yaml
custom_themes:
  my-dark:
    base: dracula
    accent: "#FF6B9D"
    text_fg: "#E8E8E8"

  my-light:
    base: dracula-light
    accent: "#0066CC"
```

**Defining a complete theme (all 11 colour fields required):**

```yaml
custom_themes:
  completely-custom:
    accent: "#00FF00"
    accent_fg: "#000000"
    accent_dim: "#2A2A2A"
    border: "#3A3A3A"
    border_dim: "#2A2A2A"
    muted_fg: "#888888"
    text_fg: "#FFFFFF"
    success_fg: "#00FF00"
    warn_fg: "#FFFF00"
    error_fg: "#FF0000"
    cyan: "#00FFFF"
```

**Inherit from other custom themes:**

```yaml
custom_themes:
  base-custom:
    base: dracula
    accent: "#FF0000"
  derived:
    base: base-custom
    accent: "#00FF00"
```

**Colour fields:** `accent`, `accent_fg`, `accent_dim`, `border`, `border_dim`, `muted_fg`, `text_fg`, `success_fg`, `warn_fg`, `error_fg`, `cyan`.

Values must be hex (`#RRGGBB` or `#RGB`). With `base`, only override what you need. Without `base`, all 11 fields are required. Custom themes appear alongside built-in themes.

## CI Status Display

Shows CI check statuses for worktrees with associated PR/MR:

* `✓` Green - Passed | `✗` Red - Failed | `●` Yellow - Pending | `○` Grey - Skipped | `⊘` Grey - Cancelled

Status is fetched lazily and cached for 30 seconds. Press `p` to refresh.
In terminals that support OSC-8 hyperlinks, the PR/MR number in the Status info panel is clickable.

## Custom Commands

Define keybindings in config. Commands run interactively (TUI suspends) and appear in the palette. Use `show_output` to pipe through pager.

Defaults: `t` = tmux, `Z` = zellij. Override via `custom_commands.t` or `custom_commands.Z`. Palette lists sessions matching `session_prefix` (default: `wt-`).

### Configuration Format

custom_commands:
  e:
    command: nvim
    description: Editor
    show_help: true
  s:
    command: zsh
    description: Shell

Single keys (`e`, `s`), modifiers (`ctrl+e`, `alt+t`), special keys (`enter`, `esc`, `tab`, `space`).

**Examples:**

```yaml
custom_commands:
  "ctrl+e":
    command: nvim
    description: Open editor with Ctrl+E
  "alt+t":
    command: make test
    description: Run tests with Alt+T
    wait: true
```

### Key Precedence

Custom commands override built-in keys.

## Custom Initialisation and Termination

Create a `.wt` file in your repository to run commands when creating/removing worktrees. Format inspired by [wt](https://github.com/taecontrol/wt).

### Example `.wt` configuration

```yaml
init_commands:
    - link_topsymlinks
    - cp $MAIN_WORKTREE_PATH/.env $WORKTREE_PATH/.env
    - npm install
    - code .

terminate_commands:
    - echo "Cleaning up $WORKTREE_NAME"
```

Environment variables: `WORKTREE_BRANCH`, `MAIN_WORKTREE_PATH`, `WORKTREE_PATH`, `WORKTREE_NAME`.

### Security: Trust on First Use (TOFU)

Since `.wt` files execute arbitrary commands, lazyworktree uses TOFU. On first encounter or modification, select **Trust**, **Block**, or **Cancel**. Hashes stored in `~/.local/share/lazyworktree/trusted.json`.

Configure `trust_mode`: `tofu` (default, prompt), `never` (skip all), `always` (no prompts).

### Special Commands

* `link_topsymlinks`: Built-in command that symlinks untracked/ignored root files, editor configs (`.vscode`, `.idea`, `.cursor`, `.claude/settings.local.json`), creates `tmp/`, and runs `direnv allow` if `.envrc` exists.

## Branch Naming Conventions

Special characters are converted to hyphens for Git compatibility. Leading/trailing hyphens are removed, consecutive hyphens collapsed. Length capped at 50 (manual) or 100 (auto) characters.

| Input | Converted |
|-------|-----------|
| `feature.new` | `feature-new` |
| `bug fix here` | `bug-fix-here` |
| `feature:test` | `feature-test` |

## Automatically Generated Branch Names

Configure `branch_name_script` to generate names via tools like [aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/) or [claude code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code). Issues/PRs output to `{generated}` placeholder; diffs output complete names.

> [!NOTE]
> Smaller, faster models suffice for branch names.

### Configuration

```yaml
# For PRs/issues: generate a title (available via {generated} placeholder)
branch_name_script: "aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite 'Generate a short title for this PR or issue. Output only the title (like feat-session-manager), nothing else.'"

# Use the generated title in PR branch/worktree naming
pr_branch_name_template: "pr-{number}-{generated}"

# For diffs: generate a complete branch name
# branch_name_script: "aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite 'Generate a short git branch name (no spaces, use hyphens) for this diff. Output only the branch name, nothing else.'"
```

### Template Placeholders

* `{number}` - PR/issue number
* `{title}` - Original sanitised title
* `{generated}` - Generated title (falls back to `{title}`)
* `{pr_author}` - PR author username (PR templates only)

**Examples:**

| Template | Result | Generated: `feat-ai-session-manager` |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `issue-{number}-{title}` | `issue-2-add-ai-session-management` (Issue #2) | Not used |
| `issue-{number}-{generated}` | `issue-2-feat-ai-session-manager` (Issue #2) | Used |
| `pr-{number}-{generated}` | `pr-7-feat-ai-session-manager` (PR #7) | Used |
| `pr-{number}-{pr_author}-{title}` | `pr-7-alice-add-ai-session-management` (PR #7 by @alice) | Not used |

If script fails, `{generated}` falls back to `{title}`.

### Script Requirements

Receives content on stdin, outputs branch name on stdout (first line). Timeout: 30s.

### Environment Variables

`LAZYWORKTREE_TYPE` (pr/issue/diff), `LAZYWORKTREE_NUMBER`, `LAZYWORKTREE_TEMPLATE`, `LAZYWORKTREE_SUGGESTED_NAME`.

**Example:**

```yaml
# Different prompts for different types
branch_name_script: |
  if [ "$LAZYWORKTREE_TYPE" = "diff" ]; then
    aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite 'Generate a complete branch name for this diff'
  else
    aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite 'Generate a short title (no issue-/pr- prefix) for this issue or PR'
  fi

# Use issue/PR number in the prompt
branch_name_script: |
  aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite "Generate a title for item #$LAZYWORKTREE_NUMBER. Output only the title."
```

## Automatically Generated Worktree Notes

Configure `worktree_note_script` to generate initial worktree notes when creating from a PR/MR or issue. The script receives the selected item's title and body on stdin and can produce multiline output. If the script fails or outputs nothing, creation continues and no note is saved.

To store notes in a single synchronisable JSON file, set `worktree_notes_path`. When enabled, keys are stored relative to the repository under `worktree_dir` instead of absolute filesystem paths.

### Configuration

```yaml
worktree_note_script: "aichat -m gemini:gemini-2.5-flash-lite 'Summarise this ticket into practical implementation notes.'"
```

### Script Requirements

Receives content on stdin, outputs note text on stdout. Timeout: 30s.

### Environment Variables

`LAZYWORKTREE_TYPE` (pr/issue), `LAZYWORKTREE_NUMBER`, `LAZYWORKTREE_TITLE`, `LAZYWORKTREE_URL`.

## CLI Usage

### Config overrides

```bash
lazyworktree --worktree-dir ~/worktrees

# Override config values via command line
lazyworktree --config lw.theme=nord --config lw.sort_mode=active
```

Create, rename, delete, and list worktrees from the command line.

### Listing Worktrees

```bash
lazyworktree list              # Table output (default)
lazyworktree list --pristine   # Paths only (scripting)
lazyworktree list --json       # JSON output
lazyworktree ls                # Alias
```

Note: `--pristine` and `--json` are mutually exclusive.

### Creating Worktrees

```bash
lazyworktree create                          # Auto-generated from current branch
lazyworktree create my-feature               # Explicit name
lazyworktree create my-feature --with-change # With uncommitted changes
lazyworktree create --from-branch main my-feature
lazyworktree create --from-pr 123
lazyworktree create --from-issue 42          # From issue (base: current branch)
lazyworktree create --from-issue 42 --from-branch main  # From issue with explicit base
lazyworktree create -I                       # Interactively select issue (fzf or list)
lazyworktree create -I --from-branch main    # Interactive issue with explicit base
lazyworktree create -P                       # Interactively select PR (fzf or list)
lazyworktree create --from-pr 123 --no-workspace        # Branch only, no worktree
lazyworktree create --from-issue 42 --no-workspace      # Branch only, no worktree
lazyworktree create -I --no-workspace                    # Interactively select issue, branch only
lazyworktree create -P --no-workspace        # Interactively select PR, branch only
lazyworktree create my-feature --exec 'npm test'        # Run command after creation
```

`--exec` runs after a successful create. It executes in the new worktree directory, or in the current directory when used with `--no-workspace`. Shell mode follows your current shell (`zsh -ilc`, `bash -ic`, otherwise `-lc`).

PR creation always uses the generated worktree name. The local branch name is conditional:
if you are the PR author, lazyworktree keeps the PR branch name; otherwise it uses the generated name.
When requester identity cannot be resolved, lazyworktree falls back to the PR branch name.

For complete CLI documentation, see `man lazyworktree` or `lazyworktree --help`.

### Deleting Worktrees

```bash
lazyworktree delete                # Delete worktree and branch
lazyworktree delete --no-branch    # Delete worktree only
```

### Renaming Worktrees

```bash
lazyworktree rename new-feature-name              # rename current worktree (detected from cwd)
lazyworktree rename feature new-feature-name
lazyworktree rename /path/to/worktree new-worktree-name
```

When renaming, the branch is renamed only if the current worktree directory name matches the branch name.

### Running Commands in Worktrees

Execute commands or trigger custom command key actions in a worktree from the CLI:

```bash
# Run a shell command in a specific worktree
lazyworktree exec --workspace=my-feature "make test"
lazyworktree exec -w my-feature "git status"

# Auto-detect worktree from current directory
cd ~/worktrees/repo/my-feature
lazyworktree exec "npm run build"

# Trigger a custom command key (e.g. tmux session)
lazyworktree exec --key=t --workspace=my-feature  # Launches tmux session
lazyworktree exec -k z -w my-feature              # Launches zellij session

# Auto-detect worktree and trigger key action
cd ~/worktrees/repo/my-feature
lazyworktree exec --key=t
```

The `exec` command:

* Uses `--workspace` (or `-w`) to specify the target worktree by name or path
* Auto-detects the worktree from the current directory if `--workspace` is not provided
* Accepts either a shell command as a positional argument, or `--key` to trigger a custom command
* Sets `WORKTREE_*` environment variables (same as custom commands in the TUI)
* Supports all custom command types: shell, tmux, zellij, and show-output
* Note: `new-tab` commands are not supported in CLI mode
