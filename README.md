## Prerequisites

- **Go**: 1.25+ (for building from source)
- **Git**: 2.31+ (recommended)
- **Forge CLI**: GitHub CLI (`gh`) or GitLab CLI (`glab`) for repo resolution and PR/MR status.

**Optional:**

- **delta**: For syntax-highlighted diffs.
- **lazygit**: For full TUI git control.

## Installation

### From Source

Clone the repository and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree.git
cd lazyworktree
go build -o lazyworktree ./cmd/lazyworktree
```

Install to your PATH:

```bash
go install ./cmd/lazyworktree
```

Or build and run directly:

```bash
go run ./cmd/lazyworktree/main.go
```

You can override the default worktree root:

```bash
lazyworktree --worktree-dir ~/worktrees
```

### Pre-built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for various platforms are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree/releases) section.

### 🍺 Homebrew

```shell
brew tap chmouel/lazyworktree https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree
brew install lazyworktree
```

## [Arch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazyworktree-bin)

```shell
yay -S lazyworktree-bin
```

## Shell Integration (Zsh)

To enable the "jump" functionality (changing your shell's current directory on exit), add the helper functions from `shell/functions.shell` to your `.zshrc`. The helper uses `--output-selection` to write the selected path to a temp file.

Example configuration:

```bash
# Add to .zshrc
source /path/to/lazyworktree/shell/functions.shell

# Create an alias for a specific repository
# worktree storage key is derived from the origin remote (e.g. github.com:owner/repo)
# and falls back to the directory basename when no remote is set.
pm() { worktree_jump ~/path/to/your/main/repo "$@"; }
```

Now you can run `pm` to open the TUI, select a worktree, and upon pressing `Enter`, your shell will `cd` into that directory.

You can also jump directly to a worktree by name and enable completion:

```bash
pm() { worktree_jump ~/path/to/your/main/repo "$@"; }
_pm() { _worktree_jump ~/path/to/your/main/repo; }
compdef _pm pm
```

If you want a shortcut to the last-selected worktree, use the built-in
`worktree_go_last` helper (reads the `.last-selected` file):

```bash
alias pl='worktree_go_last ~/path/to/your/main/repo'
```

## Custom Initialization and Termination

You can create a `.wt` file in your main repository to define custom commands to run when creating or removing a worktree. This format is inspired by [wt](https://github.com/taecontrol/wt).

### Example `.wt` configuration

```yaml
init_commands:
    - link_topsymlinks
    - cp $MAIN_WORKTREE_PATH/.env $WORKTREE_PATH/.env
    - npm install
    - code .

terminate_commands:
    - echo "Cleaning up $WORKTREE_NAME"
```

The following environment variables are available to your commands:

- `WORKTREE_BRANCH`: Name of the git branch.
- `MAIN_WORKTREE_PATH`: Path to the main repository.
- `WORKTREE_PATH`: Path to the new worktree being created or removed.
- `WORKTREE_NAME`: Name of the worktree (directory name).

### Security: Trust on First Use (TOFU)

Since `.wt` files allow executing arbitrary commands found in a repository, `lazyworktree` implements a **Trust on First Use** security model to prevent malicious repositories from running code on your machine automatically.

- **First Run**: When `lazyworktree` encounters a new or modified `.wt` file, it will pause and display the commands it intends to run. You can **Trust** (run and save), **Block** (skip for now), or **Cancel** the operation.
- **Trusted**: Once trusted, commands run silently in the background until the `.wt` file changes again.
- **Persistence**: Trusted file hashes are stored in `~/.local/share/lazyworktree/trusted.json`.

You can configure this behavior in `config.yaml` via the `trust_mode` setting:

- **`tofu`** (Default): Prompts for confirmation on new or changed files. Secure and usable.
- **`never`**: Never runs commands from `.wt` files. Safest for untrusted environments.
- **`always`**: Always runs commands without prompting. Useful for personal/internal environments but risky.

### Special Commands

- `link_topsymlinks`: This is a built-in automation command (not a shell command) that runs without TOFU prompts once the `.wt` file is trusted. It performs:
  - Symlinks all untracked and ignored files from the root of the main worktree to the new worktree (excluding subdirectories).
  - Symlinks common editor configurations (`.vscode`, `.idea`, `.cursor`, `.claude`).
  - Ensures a `tmp/` directory exists in the new worktree.
  - Automatically runs `direnv allow` if a `.envrc` file is present.

## Custom Commands

You can define custom keybindings in your `~/.config/lazyworktree/config.yaml` to execute commands in the selected worktree. Custom commands are executed interactively (the TUI suspends, just like when launching `lazygit`).

### Configuration Format

Add a `custom_commands` section to your config:

```yaml
custom_commands:
  e:
    command: nvim
    description: Open editor
    show_help: true
  s:
    command: zsh
    description: Open shell
    show_help: true
  t:
    command: make test
    description: Run tests
    show_help: false
    wait: true
  l:
    command: ls -la
    description: List files
    show_help: true
    wait: true
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `command` | string | **required** | The command to execute |
| `description` | string | `""` | Description shown in help screen |
| `show_help` | bool | `false` | Whether to show this command in the help screen (`?`) |
| `wait` | bool | `false` | Wait for key press after command completes (useful for quick commands like `ls` or `make test`) |

### Environment Variables

Custom commands have access to the same environment variables as init/terminate commands:

- `WORKTREE_BRANCH`: Name of the git branch
- `MAIN_WORKTREE_PATH`: Path to the main repository
- `WORKTREE_PATH`: Path to the selected worktree
- `WORKTREE_NAME`: Name of the worktree (directory name)

### Supported Key Formats

Custom commands support the same key formats as built-in keybindings:

- **Single keys**: `e`, `s`, `t`, `l`, etc.
- **Modifier combinations**: `ctrl+e`, `ctrl+t`, `alt+s`, etc.
- **Special keys**: `enter`, `esc`, `tab`, `space`, etc.

**Examples:**

```yaml
custom_commands:
  "ctrl+e":
    command: nvim
    description: Open editor with Ctrl+E
  "alt+t":
    command: make test
    description: Run tests with Alt+T
    wait: true
```

### Key Precedence

**Custom commands take precedence over built-in keys.** If you define a custom command with key `s`, it will override the built-in sort toggle. This allows you to fully customize your workflow.

## Key Bindings

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Jump to worktree (exit and cd) |
| `c` | Create new worktree |
| `m` | Rename selected worktree |
| `D` | Delete selected worktree |
| `d` | View diff (auto-refreshes) |
| `F` | Full-screen diff viewer |
| `A` | Absorb worktree into main |
| `X` | Prune merged worktrees |
| `p` | Fetch PR/MR status (also refreshes CI checks) |
| `o` | Open PR/MR in browser |
| `ctrl+p`, `P` | Command palette |
| `g` | Open LazyGit |
| `r` | Refresh list |
| `R` | Fetch all remotes |
| `f`, `/` | Filter worktrees |
| `s` | Toggle sort (Name/Last Active) |
| `?` | Show help |

**Command Palette Actions:**

- **Create from PR/MR**: Select an open PR/MR to create a worktree. Auto-generates a name (`pr{number}-{sanitized-title}`) that you can edit.
- **Create from changes**: Create a new worktree from the current uncommitted changes in the selected worktree. Stashes all changes (including untracked files), creates a new worktree, and applies the stashed changes to it. Requires a worktree to be selected and have uncommitted changes.

### Mouse Controls

- **Click**: Select and focus panes or items
- **Scroll Wheel**: Scroll through lists and content
  - Worktree table (left pane)
  - Info/Diff viewer (right top pane)
  - Log table (right bottom pane)

## Configuration

Worktrees are expected to be organized under
`~/.local/share/worktrees/<repo_name>` by default, though the script attempts
to resolve locations via `gh repo view` or `glab repo view`.

### Global Config (YAML)

lazyworktree reads `~/.config/lazyworktree/config.yaml` (or `.yml`) for default
settings. Example (also in [config.example.yaml](./config.example.yaml)):

```yaml
worktree_dir: ~/.local/share/worktrees
sort_by_active: true
auto_fetch_prs: false
max_untracked_diffs: 10
max_diff_chars: 200000
trust_mode: "tofu" # Options: "tofu" (default), "never", "always"
init_commands:
  - link_topsymlinks
terminate_commands:
  - echo "Cleaning up $WORKTREE_NAME"
custom_commands:
  e:
    command: nvim
    description: Open editor
    show_help: true
    wait: false
```

Notes:

- `--worktree-dir` overrides `worktree_dir`.
- `init_commands` and `terminate_commands` run before any repo-specific `.wt`
  commands (if present).
- Set `sort_by_active` to `false` to sort by path.
- Set `auto_fetch_prs` to `true` to fetch PR data on startup.
- Use `max_untracked_diffs: 0` to hide untracked diffs; `max_diff_chars: 0` disables truncation.

## CI Status Display

When viewing a worktree with an associated PR/MR, lazyworktree automatically fetches and displays CI check statuses in the info pane:

- `✓` **Green** - Passed
- `✗` **Red** - Failed
- `●` **Yellow** - Pending/Running
- `○` **Gray** - Skipped
- `⊘` **Gray** - Cancelled

CI status is fetched lazily (only for the selected worktree) and cached for 30 seconds to keep the UI snappy. Press `p` to force a refresh of CI status.

## Speed performance

`lazyworktree` is designed to be super snappy:

- **Caching**: It caches worktree metadata in `.worktree-cache.json` (located at `<worktree_dir>/<repo_name>/`), allowing the TUI to render in milliseconds upon startup.
- **Background Updates**: As soon as the UI is visible, a background task refreshes the data from Git and updates the cache automatically.
- **Welcome Screen**: If no worktrees are detected (e.g., during first-time use or in an unconfigured directory), a welcome screen guides you through the setup.

## Trivia

This used to be a python textual application, but the startup-time was too slow and I have decided to move it to a go [charmbracelet bubble](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) based TUI. You can still see or try if you want the old python interface here <https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree/tree/python>
