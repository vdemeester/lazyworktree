# Migration Plan: Python to Go Feature Parity

This document tracks missing features in the Go implementation compared to the Python implementation. Items are organized by priority and complexity.

## Current Status

The Go port has a **solid architectural foundation** with proper separation of concerns, correct concurrency patterns, and a well-structured codebase. However, several user-facing features are stubbed or missing.

**Architecture Status:** ✅ Complete
**Core TUI:** ✅ Complete
**Git Operations:** ⚠️ Partial (rename works; create/delete/prune/absorb still stubbed)
**Feature Parity:** ✅ ~65-70% complete (P2 diff/delta/debounced shipped; P1 mutations/.wt still missing)

**Recent Updates:**
- ✅ Rename worktree implemented with modal validation (non-main guard, conflict checks)
- ✅ Three-part diff with delta highlighting and auto-diff when dirty
- ✅ Debounced detail view updates plus vim-style navigation and adaptive layout tuning
- ✅ Create/Delete/Prune implemented (basic flows; `.wt`/TOFU/env commands still outstanding)
- ✅ Absorb worktree, Welcome screen trigger, Commit detail viewer wired (no `.wt`/TOFU yet)

---

## Current Implementation Session (2025-12-30)

**Focus:** Sync plan with shipped P2 UX polish and surface remaining P1 gaps

**Completed:**
- [x] 2.5 Debounced Detail View Updates (Low complexity) ✅
- [x] 2.4 Delta Integration (Low complexity) ✅
- [x] 2.3 Enhanced Diff View - Three-part diff (Medium complexity) ✅

**Deferred (require Priority 1 infrastructure):**
- 2.2 Absorb Worktree (needs `.wt` files + TOFU integration for commands)
- 2.1 Command Palette (complex, nice-to-have)

**Implementation Summary:**
1. ✅ Debouncing: 200ms delay prevents excessive git calls during rapid navigation
2. ✅ Delta: Automatic detection and application with silent fallback
3. ✅ Enhanced Diff: Three sections (staged/unstaged/untracked) with config limits
4. ✅ Auto-diff: Automatically shows diff in status pane when worktree is dirty
5. ✅ Improved status formatting: Color-coded status indicators (M/A/D/??)
6. ✅ Viewport navigation: Full vim-style navigation (j/k, Ctrl+D/U, g/G, PageUp/Down)
7. ✅ Adaptive layout: Right pane expands to ~80% when focused for better diff/log viewing

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/app/app.go` - Added debouncing, delta usage, three-part diff integration, auto-diff display, improved status formatting, viewport navigation
- `internal/app/screens.go` - Updated help text with new navigation keys
- `internal/git/service.go` - Added delta detection/application, BuildThreePartDiff()

## Architecture Differences to Consider

### Python → Go Translation Patterns

| Python Pattern | Go Equivalent | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| `async/await` | goroutines + channels | Use tea.Cmd pattern |
| `@dataclass` | struct | Already done correctly |
| `push_screen(callback)` | Screen state + channels | Need callback mechanism |
| `@work(exclusive=True)` | tea.Cmd with cancellation | Context support needed |
| List comprehensions | for loops | More verbose but clear |
| `Optional[T]` | `*T` or separate bool | Already done correctly |
| Exception handling | Error returns | Already done correctly |

### Key Challenges

1. **Modal Screen Callbacks**: Python's `push_screen(screen, callback)` pattern needs adaptation to Go's message-passing model
2. **Async Screen Dismissal**: Python uses futures; Go needs channels or tea.Cmd messages
3. **Environment Variable Expansion**: Python's `os.path.expanduser()` → Go's `os.ExpandEnv()` or `filepath.Join(os.Getenv("HOME"), ...)`
4. **YAML Parsing**: Python's type coercion is more forgiving; Go needs explicit handling
5. **Command Execution**: Python's `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` → Go's `exec.CommandContext` (already done)

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **TOFU Security Integration**: Critical for safe `.wt` execution; must not introduce vulnerabilities
2. **Partial Operation Failures**: Delete/absorb workflows have multiple steps; need rollback/cleanup logic
3. **Merge Conflicts in Absorb**: Must handle gracefully without data loss

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Environment Variable Handling**: Must match Python behavior exactly
2. **Screen Callback Pattern**: Core UX depends on this working smoothly
3. **Delta Integration**: Optional but users expect it; must degrade gracefully

### Low Risk Items
1. Command palette (nice-to-have)
2. Debouncing (minor UX improvement)
3. Full-screen diff viewer (optional alternative)

---

## Success Criteria

The Go implementation will achieve feature parity when:

1. ✅ All Priority 1 features are implemented and tested
2. ✅ All Priority 2 features are implemented (except command palette)
3. ✅ `.wt` file execution works with TOFU security
4. ✅ No data loss or corruption in any operation
5. ✅ Error messages match Python version quality
6. ✅ Performance is equal or better than Python version
7. ✅ At least 50% test coverage on critical paths

---

## Notes for Implementers

### Development Guidelines
1. **Read Python implementation first**: Understand the full workflow before coding
2. **Test incrementally**: Add tests as you implement each feature
3. **Preserve user safety**: Never compromise on TOFU security or data validation
4. **Match UX exactly**: Users expect consistent behavior across implementations
5. **Use Go idioms**: Don't try to write Python in Go; use channels, goroutines, error returns

### Common Pitfalls
- ❌ Don't skip TOFU integration - security is critical
- ❌ Don't forget environment variables in command execution
- ❌ Don't ignore partial failure scenarios
- ❌ Don't skip validation (path existence, name conflicts, etc.)
- ❌ Don't forget to refresh worktree list after mutations

### Quick Wins
- ✅ Rename worktree (1.3) - implemented
- Prune merged (1.4) - simple once delete works (still pending delete routine)
- ✅ Delta integration (2.4) - small, high-value feature
- ✅ Debouncing (2.5) - tiny change, big UX improvement
